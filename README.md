# Palindrome-Treasure-Hunt-Game
Unlock the four clue boxes, get your clues, and try to open the treasure. Each clue box is secured with a nine-digit palindrome password. Remember, every password's first and last digit represent the room number. The password consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, where every digit appears twice, except for the digit representing the room you are trying to unlock. The treasure is hidden in the fifth room. Start in the 1st room and work your way through to find the treasure!
